            <h1>Saving results</h1>

            <p>Once the analysis is complete, the user can save results by navigating to "File > Save as..." or the key
                combination "Ctrl + S". By its flexibility, "ease-of-use" and wide range of programming languages that
                can parse it, the JSON format was chosen. The final file will look as in the next image.</p>

            <img src="./images/savingJSON.png" alt="savingJSON" width=60%>

            <p>In a hierarchical organization, the file will show the original movie name and basic metadata
                on which the analysis was made. It will present enhanced non-aligned trajectories per channel (the
                contents of each row are identified) and inferred diffusion parameters. GProcess will always present
                results determined from individual trajectories. In cells (or groups) containing multiple spots, the
                coupled analysis will be provided along with substrate data. Finally, the alignment plugin will save
                its own data, that is, image dimensions and optimal translation, scaling and rotation parameters. For
                convenience, a ready-to-use transformation matrix is also provided. This matrix can be directly used
                to alignment trajectories if necessary.</p>
