            <h1>Trajectory plugin</h1>

            <p>Once the movie was imported, the user is able to load tracked trajectories into GP-Tool. There are 3
                possible ways to do so: </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Clicking on File > Load trajectories...</li>
                <li>Selecting Trajectory plugin under plugins tab and the "Load" button</li>
                <li>Key combination "Ctrl + T"</li>
            </ol>

            <img src="./images/trajectoryStart.png" alt="trajectoryStart" width=60%>

            <p>Any of these options will open a dialog where the user will be able to load a track file per channel.
                At this point, the user should also set an average size expected for spots. This value will be later
                used
                to enhance localization and estimate positional errors among other properties for each spot. If, for
                any reason, the user wants to change this value, there is the possibility to reload trajectories with a
                different expected size from within the plugin's properties tab.</p>

            <img src="./images/trajectorySelection.png" alt="trajectorySelection" width=60%>

            <p>By default, GP-Tool accepts XML track files from ICY software or "handmade" CSV files. The
                following image shows how these files should resemble.</p>

            <img src="./images/trajectoryInputFiles.png" alt="trajectoryInputFiles" width=90%>

            <p>By clicking on load, GP-Tool will launch a set of algorithms to characterize each spot and remove
                possible outliers, such as false positives. Upon completion, the properties panel will open a tab for
                each channel in which all trajectories should have an unique color code assigned. The same color will
                be used to circulate corresponding spot in the view port if spot is checked.</p>

            <p>The user can check further details about the trajectory described by each spot clicking in the button
                "detail". This option will open a tab containing information about detected frames, corresponding
                elapsed times in seconds (if metadata is properly configured), position in X and Y, localization error
                in X and Y, spot size in X and Y, background and above background signal. All coordinates, errors
                and sizes are given in pixels.</p>

            <img src="./images/trajectoryPlugin.png" alt="trajectoryPlugin" width=90%>

            <p>Aiming for a more intuitive analysis, clicking in "View plots" on top of the table, the user will be
                presented with plots containing information about the spot's position over time with a
                interval, spot size and signal as follows</p>

            <img src="./images/trajectoryPlots.png" alt="trajectoryPlots" width=95%>

            <p>Finally, the user can choose to save this table in a CSV file by clicking on the "Export" button, which
                will open a save dialog.</p>
