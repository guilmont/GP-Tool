            <p>In order to facilitate the analysis of hundreds of movies at a time, the core functions available in GP-
                Tool are wrapped in shared C++ libraries that can be linked to any C++ code. Depending on public
                demand, I might write python bindings for these libraries in the future. A template C++ program is
                provided in the GitHub repository along with a "CMakeLists.txt" which the user might use to compile
                its own program. I don't propose any standard mechanism to save output data as different types of
                analysis require alternative results to be saved. That said, popular formats I frequently use are HDF5,
                JSON and GDM (my own creation and also available in my
                <a href="http://github.com/guilmont" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub page</a>.
            </p>

            <p>For the sake of effciency in the case of Windows users, I suggest installing WSL2. On my personal
                computer, I got an improvement of about 40% in terms of speed.</p>
